# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.

As a scope of this project, we are tasked to create and optimize ML pipelineusing the Python SDK for which, a custom-coded standard [Scikit-learn Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) model is provided. 
Utilizing knowledge acquired throughut this course, we need to optimize Hyperparametes using **[HyperDrive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-train-core/azureml.train.hyperdrive?view=azure-ml-py)** package of Azue Python SDK. Result of this method needs to be compared with a model built and optimized using **[Azure AutoML](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/machine-learning/automatedml/)** on the same dataset.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**
### Problem Statement

In this project, we are using the [UCI Bank Marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) dataset to build and optimize ML model for a classification problem. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a tem deposite with the bank.

### Input variables:

Bank Client Data:

1. `age` (numeric)
2. `job` : type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')
3. `marital` : marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)
4. `education` (categorical: 'basic.4y','basic.6y','basic.9y','high.school','illiterate','professional.course','university.degree','unknown')
5. `default`: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
6. `housing`: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
7. `loan`: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')

Related with the last contact of the current campaign:
8. `contact`: contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone')
9. `month`: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')
10. `day_of_week`: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')
11. `duration`: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.

Other Attributes:
12. `campaign`: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
13. `pdays`: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
14. `previous`: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
15. `poutcome`: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')

Social and Economic Context Attributes
16. `emp.var.rate`: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)
17. `cons.price.idx`: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)
18. `cons.conf.idx`: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)
19. `euribor3m`: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)
20. `nr.employed`: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)

### Output variable (desired target):

21. `y`: has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**

## Proof of cluster clean up
**If you did not delete your compute cluster in the code, please complete this section. Otherwise, delete this section.**
Following command is executed to delete compute cluster created

```
cpu_cluster.delete()
```
