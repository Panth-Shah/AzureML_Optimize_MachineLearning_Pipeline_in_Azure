# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.

As a scope of this project, we are tasked to create and optimize ML pipelineusing the Python SDK for which, a custom-coded standard [Scikit-learn Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) model is provided. 
Utilizing knowledge acquired throughut this course, we need to optimize Hyperparametes using **[HyperDrive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-train-core/azureml.train.hyperdrive?view=azure-ml-py)** package of Azue Python SDK. Result of this method needs to be compared with a model built and optimized using **[Azure AutoML](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/machine-learning/automatedml/)** on the same dataset.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**

## Proof of cluster clean up
**If you did not delete your compute cluster in the code, please complete this section. Otherwise, delete this section.**
Following command is executed to delete compute cluster created

```
cpu_cluster.delete()
```
